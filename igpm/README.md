# IGPM - Indice Geral de Precos do Mercado (Brazil)

IGP-M / FGV is calculated monthly by FGV and is disclosed at the end of each reference month.

The IGP-M when conceived was intended as an indicator to guide the corrections of some securities issued by the National Treasury and Bank Deposits with post-fixed income over one year. Subsequently, it became the index used to correct rental agreements and to index some tariffs such as electricity.

The IGP-M / FGV analyzes the same price variations considered in the IGP-DI / FGV, ie the Wholesale Price Index (IPA), which has a weight of 60% of the index, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has a weight of 30% and the National Construction Cost Index (INCC), representing 10% of the IGP-M.
